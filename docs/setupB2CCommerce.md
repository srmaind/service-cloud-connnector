**What is the service-cloud-connector?**  
A [Salesforce Labs](https://twitter.com/salesforce_labs?lang=en) project that facilitates an "above the API" integration between Salesforce B2C Commerce and Service Clouds.

## Setting Up Salesforce B2C Commerce
###### This guide captures the configuration and installation activities necessary to enable the service-cloud-connector's integration with Salesforce B2C Commerce.

### What You Need to Get Started

Before moving forward with the installation instructions, verify that your cross-cloud environment meets all installation prerequisites.  

#### Installation Prerequisites

- A Salesforce B2C Commerce sandbox running a storefront based on [SiteGenesis](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sitegenesis) OR [Storefront Reference Architecture](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/storefront-reference-architecture).
- A Service Cloud sandbox mirroring your production org with [PersonAccounts](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=account_person.htm&type=5) and [Lightning](https://www.salesforce.com/campaign/lightning/) enabled.

#### Disqualifying Configurations

- A Salesforce B2C Storefront running on the Pipelines.
- A Service Cloud environment that runs on Salesforce Classic.
- A Service Cloud environment that does not support [PersonAccounts](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=account_person.htm&type=5).

> All installation prerequisites must be met in order for the service-cloud-connector to successfully deliver its complete feature-set.

### Configuring a Salesforce B2C Commerce Environment
This section of the document describes how to configure a Salesforce B2C Commerce environment to enable the service-cloud-connector's feature-set.

Be sure to select the SiteGenesis/SFRA-based site that will leverage the connector via the Site Selector found in the Business Manager header.

> In order to move forward with the configuration activities, ensure that you have access to a Business Manager account with Administrative privileges.

#### Import the Service Cloud Connector's Site Preferences
The service-cloud-connector introduces three site preferences to manage the operation of the service-cloud-connector within the Salesforce B2C Commerce environment.  This section of the document provides guidance on how to upload, import, and configure the site preferences.
